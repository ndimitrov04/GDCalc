# GDCalc
A simple damage calculator for the game Genshin Impact.  
Every online calculator for this game requires a lot of time to use since most of them do not allow the direct input of a character's stats.  
They require all of a character's <i>artifact stats</i> to be filled in instead. Which means that instead of 6-7 fields, the user needs to input  
25+ fields. This calculator aims to eliminate that problem by giving the user a way to write the main 7 stats needed for damage calculation directly.
